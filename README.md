# Introduction

[CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) is an interpreted language from the 70's that could run simple video-games.

Making a CHIP-8 interpreter is a classing learning programming project. I made mine in 2013, after [green-snake](https://github.com/a-robu/green-snake) and [py-asteroird](https://github.com/a-robu/py-asteroird).
