# Introduction

This project is a [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) interpreter written in Python. CHIP-8 is an interpreted language from the 70's that could run simple video-games.

Making a CHIP-8 interpreter is a classing learner's programming project. I made mine in 2013, after [green-snake](https://github.com/a-robu/green-snake) and [py-asteroird](https://github.com/a-robu/py-asteroird).

# How to Play

Computers that ran CHIP-8 had a hexadecimal keyboard with keys from 1 to F, arranged in a 4x4 grid.

This interpreter maps them to QWERTY keyboards as shown in the following drawing.
